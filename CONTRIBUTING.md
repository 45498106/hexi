##Setting up

Hexi uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as its build pipeline. The first thing you'll need is [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
Yarn is a package manager like npm but with smarter caching and better version control. Once you've got it, from the root of the repository,
run `yarn install` and yarn will take care of grabbing the dependencies. Some people have problems installing gulp 4; if you do,
you may have to [install it manually](https://www.liquidlight.co.uk/blog/article/how-do-i-update-to-gulp-4/).
